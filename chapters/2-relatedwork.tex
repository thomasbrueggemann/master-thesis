\section{Combining Source Code Analysis with Information Privacy Risk Assessment}

\mH apps have been examined in various research studies that aim at providing insights for developers as well as users into how private information is processed.
Privacy issues are the most impactful user complaint while using mobile apps.\footnote{See \cite{Khalid2015}, p. 5.}
This encourages research to address information privacy risks.

Research focus has been put on the technical side of information privacy breach. 
It has been analyzed, to what degree the data storage in internal Android log files or on the memory card within a phone or tablet poses a threat to users information privacy.\footnote{For the previous two sentences, see \cite{He2014}, p. 645-646.}
Technical evaluation of mobile apps even goes further into the topics of decompilation to analyze device identification or geolocation data leaks.\footnote{See \cite{Mcclurg2012}, p. 1, 5., \cite{Enck2011}, p. 1. and \cite{Mitchell2013}, p.6-7.}
Decompilation reveals to be a feasible assessment technique for \ipr and data leaks.

In informatics and software development contexts, \sca has been used to analyze source code and provide feedback on coding styles to the users  while programming or "to find defects in programs"\footnote{\cite{Bardas2010}, p. 1.}.
\Sca provides a fast way to analyze source code\footnote{See \cite{Bardas2010}, p. 5.}, which makes it suitable to automate the assessment of large datasets.
A further benefit of using \sca to retrieve information from software is that the software does not need to be executed during the analyzation process.
This additionally supports the development of fast performing assessment tools that are suitable for application on large datasets of source code since there is no need to wait for the application runtime to execute the software.

Our study will use the benefits of \sca and apply them to the assessment of \mH information privacy risks.
It is unclear if \sca is a viable tool to analyze and identify information privacy risk factors.
We will use the comprehensive privacy-risk-relevant information privacy practices that \cite{Dehling2016} identified\footnote{See \cite{Dehling2016}, p. 8-17.} and try to implement \sca strategies to identify those risks automatically.
This will be a vital addition to current research, since there is yet no holistic approach to apply \sca to \ipr detection that takes an ample amount of \iprfs into account.

\subsection{Relevant Information Privacy Risk Factors}

For this thesis, we will use the set of \ipp extracted from literature, the Platform for Privacy Preferences (\acs{P3P})\footnote{https://www.w3.org/TR/P3P/, visited 06/06/2016} and app reviews by \cite{Dehling2016} as a source to derive \iprfs from. \footnote{For this and the following sentence, see \cite{Dehling2016}, p. 1-2.} 
\Ipp are common practices that app providers should follow in order to achieve transparency of information practices.
A hierarchy of \ipp is formed by clustering the \ipp by their content aspects. 
The top level of the hierarchy are the nodes 'Content' and 'Practice'.
The 'Content' hierarchy level e.g. contains sub-hierarchy branches that express \ipp concerning the handling of information content, the information collection content and meta content about information collection, information on offered privacy controls and information on what purpose the \ipp was collected for.
The sub-hierarchy branches of the top-level 'Practice' contain e.g. information on the existence of dispute resolution practices or access rights practices of the users.

Since not all of the enlisted \ipp express or imply an information privacy risk to app users, we review and extract the \ipp that are relevant in terms of posing and expressing a potential information privacy risk.
We will further limit the \ipp by excluding \ipp that are technically infeasible to detect via static code analysis.
An example for such an exclusion is the \ipp 'InformationRetentionContent', which captures, if an app provider carries out a certain information retention policy or not.\footnote{See \cite{Dehling2016}, p. 8.}
This is a feature that is undetectable by \sca and beyond the scope of app source code analysis.
We include a full list of all \ipp in Appendix A with a detailed comment on the technical limitations, if any, towards each \ipp.
