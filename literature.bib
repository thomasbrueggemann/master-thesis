@article{Marston.2011,
 abstract = {The evolution of cloud computing over the past few years is potentially one of the major advances in the history of computing. However, if cloud computing is to achieve its potential, there needs to be a clear understanding of the various issues involved, both from the perspectives of the providers and the consumers of the technology. While a lot of research is currently taking place in the technology itself, there is an equally urgent need for understanding the business-related issues surrounding cloud computing. In this article, we identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the cloud computing industry. We then identify the various issues that will affect the different stakeholders of cloud computing. We also issue a set of recommendations for the practitioners who will provide and manage this technology. For IS researchers, we outline the different areas of research that need attention so that we are in a position to advice the industry in the years to come. Finally, we outline some of the key issues facing governmental agencies who, due to the unique nature of the technology, will have to become intimately involved in the regulation of cloud computing.

@article{Nallur.2012,
 abstract = {Cloud computing, with its promise of (almost) unlimited computation, storage and bandwidth, is increasingly becoming the infrastructure of choice for many organizations. As cloud offerings mature, service-based applications need to dynamically recompose themselves, to self-adapt to changing QoS requirements. In this paper, we present a decentralized mechanism for such self-adaptation, using market-based heuristics. We use a continuous double-auction to allow applications to decide which services to choose, amongst the many on offer. We view an application as a multi-agent system, and the cloud as a marketplace where many such applications self-adapt. We show through a simulation study that our mechanism is effective, for the individual application as well as from the collective perspective of all applications adapting at the same time.},

Der erste Beitrag dieses Artikels ist deshalb die eingehende Diskussion der verschiedenen Charakteristika von jeweils Grid- und Cloud-Computing.

In diesem Arti- kel wird hierzu zun{\"a}chst ein Framework f{\"u}r Gesch{\"a}ftsmodelle in Clouds aufgestellt.
